                  Venti is a smart thermostat and vent controller designed to offer users a convenient way to control their home's heating and ventilation systems. 
                  The system automatically adjusts its vent fin angles to increase or decrease airflow in an effort to drive temperatures to the user's set goals.
                  Theoreticallly, the system also supports actual temperature control of a home's existing thermostat. The device's objective is to limit actual thermostat 
                  changes, and to maximize its airflow angles to achieve the user's desired temperature.
                  This project was co-founded with three other members of my cohort at the University of Waterloo to serve as our Capstone project. The inspiration for
                  this project came from the fact that space heating largely dominates the Canadian residential energy consumption and the lack of minute control HVAC systems
                  can offer in multi-person homes. As such, the system's competitive edge are its relatively inexpensiveness, airflow recycling, and device-agnostic platform.

                  My responsibilities in this project were software-based, for example designing and developing the two-way LoRa communication protocol between the central
                  vent hub and the vents themselves. More specifically, this involved structuring the data packets that the devices would communicate to each other. This required
                  a consideration of the data packet size limits due to the volume of information that needed to be communicated. For example, a data packet from the vent sent to 
                  the hub would include its id number, current temperature, current vent angle, and sensory information such as humidity, pressure, and air quality. For the most up-to 
                  date information while preserving battery life, I also assisted in writing sleep software to keep the vent in low-power idling mode when not sending/receiving data packets
                  (60 seconds). Aside from device communication, I also assisted with the user interface design, which involved the creation of a live-updating dashboard written in HTML & CSS.

                  During my Co-Op experience at BenQ in Taiwan, I spearheaded an exciting project aimed at enhancing the bug tracking capabilities of the quality assurance team. 
                  From the very outset, starting with the initial design stage, planning, and design mockups, I was entrusted with complete authority and accountability for the entire project.
                  The culmination of my efforts was the development of a cutting-edge Chrome extension that revolutionized the process of reporting bugs to our internal bug tracking system, Mantis. 
                  Leveraging the secure APIs provided by Mantis, I implemented a seamless authentication mechanism within the extension. Once authenticated, users gained access to a plethora of powerful features and functionalities.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The Chrome extension empowered users with the flexibility to select the specific project or folder to which the bug ticket should be directed, ensuring streamlined organization and efficient workflow management. 
                  To comply with Mantis's requirements for bug submission, I designed an intuitive form within the extension, capturing all the necessary information needed for comprehensive bug reports.
                  Furthermore, I integrated a sleek modal window into the extension, leveraging Chrome's inherent capabilities for capturing screenshots and enabling image annotation. 
                  This feature allowed users to provide visual context and annotations directly within the bug reports, aiding the quality assurance team in precisely identifying and resolving issues.
               </p>
               <p>
                  To realize this project, I employed React, a powerful and popular JavaScript library, enabling the development of a highly responsive and dynamic user interface. 
                  The extension itself was a pure front-end application, seamlessly integrating with Chrome's extensions ecosystem to deliver a seamless user experience.
                  Overall, my Co-Op project at BenQ enabled me to take charge of the entire development process, from conception to deployment, resulting in a sophisticated Chrome extension that significantly accelerated the quality assurance team's bug tracking capabilities.

               <h2>Broadcasting Prototype</h2>
               <p>
                  This project was conducted during my second Co-Op at BenQ in Taiwan. This involved the prototyping of broadcasting capabilities to be used in BenQ's televisions. In my personal prototyping,
                  I opted to create the project using a website instead of using the native operating system of the television due to my own efficiencies with web development. In the initial stage, research
                  into possible viable solutions were conducted, ultimately deciding between Socket.io and Amazon Kinesis. Ultimately, a minimum viable product was established using Socket.io as using Amazon Kinesis 
                  would have involved a steeper development time, hindering the project's prototyping time. As well, Kinesis did not offer Javascript capabilities on server side functionality. This project was ultimately
                  fully implemented within a month and demonstrations of its capabilities to higher management were successful.

               <p>
                  This was my first ever project working as a web developer in my first co-op at Pixelbot. This project involved the implemention of a React-based social media hub dedicated to scraping Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook
                  posts related to a list of environmental tags. For example, if a user wanted to see all posts related to "Rainforests" in "Japan", then the website would scrape the three social media websites with 
                  their APIs to retrieve these results. For this project, I was responsible for the implementation of the front-end based on designs and wireframes provided by the client (WWF). I was also responsible for
                  the ip detection of users to offer translations of the website (offered by a third party company that provided expert translations), as well as customizing links to match the user's country origin. Unfortunately,
                  the connect2earth event I helped develop has ended and I'm unable to share the project's code or visuals.

                  This was less so a project and more so an exercise and practice for me to learn the full stack requirements of a web application. I worked on this project with a friend of mine <a href="https://github.com/LinsamuelATM">Samuel Lin</a>.
                  For this task, I took on the role of back-end development, creating routes and endpoint protection for validated users (using JWT). The back-end was developed using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB for data storage.
                  I also made sure to extensively test my APIs using Postman. As well, I had a hand in the front-end implementation with setting up and collaborating with the other developer on what parts of the application state would
                  be managed by Redux.
