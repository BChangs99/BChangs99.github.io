                     Venti is a smart thermostat and vent controller designed to offer users a convenient way to control their home's heating and ventilation systems. 
                     The system automatically adjusts its vent fin angles to increase or decrease airflow in an effort to drive temperatures to the user's set goals.
                     Theoreticallly, the system also supports actual temperature control of a home's existing thermostat. The device's objective is to limit actual thermostat 
                     changes, and to maximize its airflow angles to achieve the user's desired temperature.
                     This project was co-founded with three other members of my cohort at the University of Waterloo to serve as our Capstone project. The inspiration for
                     this project came from the fact that space heating largely dominates the Canadian residential energy consumption and the lack of minute control HVAC systems
                     can offer in multi-person homes. As such, the system's competitive edge are its relatively inexpensiveness, airflow recycling, and device-agnostic platform.

                     My responsibilities in this project were software-based, for example designing and developing the two-way LoRa communication protocol between the central
                     vent hub and the vents themselves. More specifically, this involved structuring the data packets that the devices would communicate to each other. This required
                     a consideration of the data packet size limits due to the volume of information that needed to be communicated. For example, a data packet from the vent sent to 
                     the hub would include its id number, current temperature, current vent angle, and sensory information such as humidity, pressure, and air quality. For the most up-to 
                     date information while preserving battery life, I also assisted in writing sleep software to keep the vent in low-power idling mode when not sending/receiving data packets
                     (60 seconds). Aside from device communication, I also assisted with the user interface design, which involved the creation of a live-updating dashboard written in HTML & CSS.

                     During my Co-Op experience at BenQ in Taiwan, I spearheaded an exciting project aimed at enhancing the bug tracking capabilities of the quality assurance team. 
                     From the very outset, starting with the initial design stage, planning, and design mockups, I was entrusted with complete authority and accountability for the entire project.
                     The culmination of my efforts was the development of a cutting-edge Chrome extension that revolutionized the process of reporting bugs to our internal bug tracking system, Mantis. 
                     Leveraging the secure APIs provided by Mantis, I implemented a seamless authentication mechanism within the extension. Once authenticated, users gained access to a plethora of powerful features and functionalities.
                  </Typography>
                  <Typography paragraph>
                     The Chrome extension empowered users with the flexibility to select the specific project or folder to which the bug ticket should be directed, ensuring streamlined organization and efficient workflow management. 
                     To comply with Mantis's requirements for bug submission, I designed an intuitive form within the extension, capturing all the necessary information needed for comprehensive bug reports.
                     Furthermore, I integrated a sleek modal window into the extension, leveraging Chrome's inherent capabilities for capturing screenshots and enabling image annotation. 
                     This feature allowed users to provide visual context and annotations directly within the bug reports, aiding the quality assurance team in precisely identifying and resolving issues.

                  <Typography paragraph>
                     To realize this project, I employed React, a powerful and popular JavaScript library, enabling the development of a highly responsive and dynamic user interface. 
                     The extension itself was a pure front-end application, seamlessly integrating with Chrome's extensions ecosystem to deliver a seamless user experience.
                     Overall, my Co-Op project at BenQ enabled me to take charge of the entire development process, from conception to deployment, resulting in a sophisticated Chrome extension that significantly accelerated the quality assurance team's bug tracking capabilities.

                     During my second Co-Op experience at BenQ in Taiwan, I embarked on an exciting project focused on prototyping broadcasting capabilities for BenQ's televisions.
                     Recognizing my proficiency in web development, I made the strategic decision to create the project as a website, rather than relying on the native operating system of the television.
                  </Typography>
                  <Typography paragraph>
                     The project kicked off with an extensive research phase, aimed at identifying the most viable solutions for achieving our broadcasting goals. After careful consideration, we narrowed down our options to two prominent technologies: Socket.io and Amazon Kinesis.
                     While both options presented compelling features, we weighed the trade-offs and ultimately selected Socket.io as the foundation for our minimum viable product.
                  </Typography>
                  <Typography paragraph>
                     The decision to go with Socket.io was driven by several factors. Firstly, utilizing Amazon Kinesis would have significantly increased development time, posing a potential hurdle to the project's prototyping phase.
                     Additionally, the lack of server-side code required for Socket.io was a major advantage, as it allowed us to focus on the core functionality of the project. Finally, Socket.io's support for real-time communication was a key factor in our decision, as it was a core requirement for the project.

                     This particular undertaking involved the implementation of a React-based social media hub, specifically designed for scraping and aggregating posts from popular platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
                     The goal was to curate content related to a comprehensive list of environmental tags, providing users with a centralized platform to explore and engage with environmentally conscious discussions.

                     Additionally, I took on the challenge of integrating IP detection functionality into the website. This feature allowed us to provide personalized experiences for users by automatically detecting their geographical location. 
                     Leveraging the services of a reputable third-party translation company, we seamlessly incorporated expert translations to cater to users in their preferred language. 
                     Moreover, I ensured that the website dynamically customized links to match the user's country of origin, enhancing the overall user experience and navigation.
